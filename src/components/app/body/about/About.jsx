                    <p> JSA McGill is a rapidly-growing social/cultural organization whose goals are to promote Japanese culture and language in the local community through various events hosted throughout the school year.</p>
                    <p> We are a very diverse group of students and although some of our members are indeed Japanese, there are many non-Japanese members as well. Even though we have varying backgrounds, we all have a common interest in Japanese culture! </p> 

                    <h2> Our Mission: </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Raise awareness of traditional and modern Japanese culture. </li> 
                        <li> Create opportunities for both Japanese and non-Japanese students to practice and learn the language. </li> 
                        <li> Aid students in finding opportunities to work or intern at Japanese companies or global companies based in Japan. </li> 
                        <li> Raise funds for charities in Japan that support the well-being of the country e.g. the Tohoku relief. </li> 
                        <li> Provide students with opportunities for socializing and involvement, through social events and volunteering, from which friendships and community are built. </li> 
                        <li> Create a local Japanese community and Japanese Alumni network for the purpose of sharing information and resources. </li> 
                    </ul>
